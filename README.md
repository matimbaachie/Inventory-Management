# Inventory Management

## Project Summary  
I developed an Inventory Management system enabling businesses to track products, suppliers, and orders. Secure login and role management are handled through Azure AD.

The backend is a secure ASP.NET Core API interacting with an Azure SQL Database via EF Core. The React frontend uses MSAL.js for authentication and offers an intuitive UI for inventory operations.

## Key Features  
- Azure AD authentication with role-based permissions.  
- Product, supplier, and order CRUD operations.  
- Real-time stock level tracking and notifications.  
- Responsive React frontend with routing and state management.  
- Secure backend API protected by Azure AD tokens.  
- SQL Server database managed through EF Core migrations.  
- Hosted and deployed on Azure App Services.

## Technologies Used  
- React + MSAL.js  
- ASP.NET Core Web API + Azure AD  
- Entity Framework Core + Azure SQL Server  
- Azure App Service

## How I Delivered It  
- Configured Azure AD with roles and API permissions.  
- Designed and implemented database schema and backend APIs.  
- Created React frontend integrated with Azure AD authentication.  
- Deployed backend and frontend on Azure with environment-specific settings.  
- Provided operational documentation and deployment guides.
